# ZPredict
We develop a tool ZPredict to infer useful information through IPID side channels, which consists of IPID identification and IPID prediction algorithms based on machine learning technology to automatically classify five types of IPID assignments and measure IPID prediction ability online.
The predictive mechanism we developed is modular and can be easily integrated into existing IPID applications to capture appropriate IPIDs from the Internet.
We leverage ZPredict to implement three network applications that are highly dependent on IPID value inference: idle port scanning, IP-level censorship measurement and SAV assessment.
